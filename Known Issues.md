1. Right sidebar swipeable edge does not work with mouse pointer. (Ignored, unlikely to be a problem)

2. Stall Register Code is hardcoded in .env. (Implementation and security can be improved at the expense of performance)

3. Each staff and owner can only be associated with one stall, checked by email. (Ignored, can be "bypassed" by using multiple Google accounts but no requirement for a stall-switching interface)
