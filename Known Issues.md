1. Right sidebar swipeable edge does not work with mouse pointer. (Ignored, unlikely to be a problem)

2. Stall Register Code is hardcoded in .env. (Implementation and security can be improved at the expense of performance)

3. Each staff and owner can only be associated with one stall, checked by email. (Ignored, can be "bypassed" by using multiple Google accounts but no requirement for a stall-switching interface)

4. Authenticating with `--token` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version of `firebase-tools`. Instead, use a service account key with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started. (Ignored, can't find any official documentation on how to update this and that deprecation was very recent).

5. Profile image may return 403 when running locally on localhost. This does not happen if 127.0.0.1 is used instead. (Solved, create a .env.local file in root and add HOST=127.0.0.1 so that every npm start run uses 127.0.0.1)
